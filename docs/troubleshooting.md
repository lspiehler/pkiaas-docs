PKIaaS.io provides logging to help troubleshoot issues. Logs are available for backend services like SCEP and ACME to assist in diagnosing problems. These logs can be accessed by navigating to **Logs** in the navigation pane on the left side of the page. If you encounter issues with certificate issuance, SCEP, or other services, reviewing the logs can provide valuable insights into what went wrong. If further assistance is needed, you can reach out to the PKIaaS.io support team for help by direct message on Patreon or using the Disqus comment section on the help page of the website.

**Note**: Logs are retained for 30 days. After this period, they are automatically deleted to optimize storage and maintain system performance.
