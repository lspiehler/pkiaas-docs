# Welcome to PKIaaS.io Documentation

Thank you for visiting the documentation for PKIaaS.io. This site is under construction. Contributers are welcome!

PKIaaS.io is here to make PKI functionality—usually limited to costly, complex platforms designed for enterprise customers—accessible to a broader audience. PKIaaS.io serves not only small to medium-sized businesses but also home lab users, developers, testers, and PKI enthusiasts of all kinds!

My name is Lyas Spiehler, and I was inspired to create this site out of a passion and curiosity for PKI, as well as a desire to fill the gap in accessible resources for learning about and easily generating x509 certificates. PKIaaS.io enables the creation of all types of certificates—including SMIME, code signing, TLS/SSL, document signing, and more—while offering comprehensive services you’d expect from a robust PKI platform, such as CRL, OCSP, SCEP, ACME, time-stamping, and beyond!
