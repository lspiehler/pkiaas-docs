# Welcome to PKIaaS.io Documentation

Thank you for visiting the documentation for PKIaaS.io. This site is under construction. Contributers are welcome!

PKIaaS.io is here to make PKI functionalityâ€”usually limited to costly, complex platforms designed for enterprise customersâ€”accessible to a broader audience. PKIaaS.io was designed to serve not only small to medium-sized businesses but also home lab users, developers, testers, and PKI enthusiasts of all kinds!

My name is Lyas Spiehler, and I was inspired to create PKIaaS.io out of a passion and curiosity for PKI, as well as a desire to fill the gap in accessible resources for learning about and easily generating x509 certificates. PKIaaS.io enables the creation of all types of certificatesâ€”including SMIME, code signing, TLS/SSL, document signing, and moreâ€”while offering comprehensive services youâ€™d expect from a robust PKI platform, such as CRL, OCSP, SCEP, ACME, timestamping, certificate transparency (SCT), etc.
