To sign a CSR from the admin UI, login to [PKIaaS.io](https://pkiaas.io/auth/login){:target="_blank"}, and navigate to **Certificate Templates -> Manage Templates**. Click on the template you'd like to use, and select "Submit CSR" from the menu. Paste the contents of the CSR into the input field and click "Submit". Before the CSR is signed, it must be reviewed and approved by navigating to **X509 Certificates -> Pending Requests**. See [Pending Requests](../certificate-management/pending-requests.md) for more information on reviewing and approving pending requests.
