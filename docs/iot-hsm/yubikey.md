### Insert the YubiKey into the IoT-HSM Appliance
All that is required to use a YubiKey as an HSM with IoT-HSM is to plug it into the appliance. Next, login to the IoT-HSM. If you don't see the YubiKey listed on the main IoT-HSM page like the image below, use the reload button in the top navigation bar to refresh the list of HSMs.

**Note:** Multiple YubiKeys can be used on the same IoT-HSM appliance.
