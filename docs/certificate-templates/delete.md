To delete a certificate template, login to PKIaaS.io and navigate to **Certificate Templates -> Manage Templates** in the navigation pane on the left of the page. Click on a template and select "Edit Template". If the template has no active certificates, you can use the red Delete button to remove it. Note that all certificates issued under the template must either be expired or revoked, and the revocation reason cannot be "Certificate Hold".
