# Overview

Certificate templates are used to enforce compliance of predefined standards for issuing certificates with your certificate authority. These standards include key usages, subject attributes, basic constraints, and other certificate attributes. Certificate templates also serve as the entry point for many of the certificate issuance options on PKIaaS.io. Read more about these certificate issuance options on the [getting started page](../getting-started.md/#issue-a-certificate).
