description: Discover how supporting PKIaaS.io on Patreon helps remove account limitations and unlocks extra features.
---
PKIaaS.io relies on community support. By subscribing on Patreon, you help sustain the platform's development and maintenance. Patreon subscribers enjoy lifted account restrictions and direct communication with support.

To subscribe, log in to [PKIaaS.io](https://www.pkiaas.io/auth/login), click on your account name in the top right corner, and select "Profile." From there, click the "Become a Patron" link to log in to Patreon and choose a subscription tier.

Unsubscribed users are subject to the following limitations:

* Maximum of 10 certificates per account (excluding service certificates, e.g. SCEP, OCSP, etc)
* 30-day certificate validity period
* No certificate revocation

If a certificate authority is delegated to other users, only the CA owner must be a Patreon subscriber to lift the limitations for all delegated users using the CA. If an unsubscribed user delegates a CA to a user with an active Patreon subscription, the limitations will apply to the subscribed users using the CA.
