To edit a certificate authority, login to PKIaaS.io and navigate to **Certificate Templates -> Manage CAs** in the navigation pane on the left of the page. Click on a CA and select "Edit CA" from the menu. The CPS (certificate practice statement) can be customized here as well as the service certificate settings. The service certificate settings manage the key type, key size and hash algorithm used when creating certificates for services like time stamping and OCSP.
