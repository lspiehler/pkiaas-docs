This site is under construction. Contributers are welcome!</p> <p>PKIaaS.io is here to make PKI functionality\u2014usually limited to costly, complex platforms designed for enterprise customers\u2014accessible to a broader audience. PKIaaS.io serves not only small to medium-sized businesses but also home lab users, developers, testers, and PKI enthusiasts of all kinds!</p> <p>My name is Lyas Spiehler, and I was inspired to create this site out of a passion and curiosity for PKI, as well as a desire to fill the gap in accessible resources for learning about and easily generating x509 certificates. PKIaaS.io enables the creation of all types of certificates\u2014including SMIME, code signing, TLS/SSL, document signing, and more\u2014while offering comprehensive services you\u2019d expect from a robust PKI platform, such as CRL, OCSP, SCEP, ACME, time-stamping, and beyond!</p>"},{"location":"#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"}]}
