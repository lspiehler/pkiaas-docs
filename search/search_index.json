This site is under construction. Contributers are welcome!</p> <p>PKIaaS.io is here to make PKI functionality\u2014usually limited to costly, complex platforms designed for enterprise customers\u2014accessible to a broader audience. PKIaaS.io was designed to serve not only small to medium-sized businesses but also home lab users, developers, testers, and PKI enthusiasts of all kinds!</p> <p>My name is Lyas Spiehler, and I was inspired to create PKIaaS.io out of a passion and curiosity for PKI, as well as a desire to fill the gap in accessible resources for learning about and easily generating x509 certificates. PKIaaS.io enables the creation of all types of certificates\u2014including SMIME, code signing, TLS/SSL, document signing, and more\u2014while offering comprehensive services you\u2019d expect from a robust PKI platform, such as CRL, OCSP, SCEP, ACME, timestamping, certificate transparency (SCT), etc.</p> <p>If you're new to PKIaaS.io, be sure to check out our Getting Started\ud83d\udc48 guide!</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#login","title":"Login","text":"<p>Getting started with PKIaaS.io is easy!

Navigating to any other page of the site before you've created a CA will redirect you back to a page forcing you to create one. If you're logging in for the first time, and you haven't created a CA before, you'll be asked to choose between a managed CA and a CA backed by an HSM. If you're new to PKI or you'd just like to take PKIaaS.io for a test drive, it would be best to choose the managed option to get going more quickly.

Certificate templates are used to enforce compliance of predefined standards for issuing certificates with your CA. These standards include key usages, subject attributes, basic constraints, and other certificate attributes. The use of templates is important to prevent accidental mis-issuance and to ensure that issued certificates are compliant with your security practices.

The latter option can be helpful for users that are not familiar with x509 certificates and includes an option to generate a private key automatically in the browser when the user claims their certificate after it is approved.

Users will be automatically redirected to a setup page and prompted to create a CA before accessing other features on the site.</p> <p>Users can choose between creating a managed CA or one backed by an HSM. With a managed CA, the private key is securely stored using AES-256 encryption, offering a streamlined setup without additional configuration. Alternatively, the HSM-backed option integrates with a PKIaaS.io IoT-HSM, enabling key management via a YubiKey 5. In this setup, all signing operations are routed to the IoT-HSM, where they are processed by the YubiKey.
