This site is under construction. Contributers are welcome!</p> <p>PKIaaS.io is here to make PKI functionality\u2014usually limited to costly, complex platforms designed for enterprise customers\u2014accessible to a broader audience. PKIaaS.io was designed to serve not only small to medium-sized businesses but also home lab users, developers, testers, and PKI enthusiasts of all kinds!</p> <p>My name is Lyas Spiehler, and I was inspired to create PKIaaS.io out of a passion and curiosity for PKI, as well as a desire to fill the gap in accessible resources for learning about and easily generating x509 certificates. PKIaaS.io enables the creation of all types of certificates\u2014including SMIME, code signing, TLS/SSL, document signing, and more\u2014while offering comprehensive services you\u2019d expect from a robust PKI platform, such as CRL, OCSP, SCEP, ACME, time-stamping, certificate transparency (SCT), etc.</p> <p>If you're new to PKIaaS.io, be sure to check out our Getting Started\ud83d\udc48 guide!</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#login","title":"Login","text":"<p>Getting started with PKIaaS.io is easy!

Navigating to any other page of the site before you've create a CA will redirect you back to a page forcing you to create one. If you're logging in for the first time, and you haven't created a CA before, you'll be asked to choose between a managed CA and a CA by an HSM. If you're new to PKI or you'd just like to take PKIaaS.io for a test drive, it would be best to choose the managed option to get going more quickly. Read more about these options here.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#ca-configuration-options","title":"CA Configuration Options","text":"<p>If you're still learning about PKI, feel free to use the default options and just update the name when creating your first CA. This is the easiest option to start issuing certificates and getting a feel for the site. When you're done choosing options, click \"Create New CA\". You'll then be redirected to the \"Manage CAs\" page and your new CA will appear in the drop down at the top of the page.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#switch-cas","title":"Switch CAs","text":"<p>If you create more than one CA, you'll have the option of switching between them by selecting the one you'd like to manage from the dropdown at the top of the PKI management page to the right of the navigation pane.

Certificate templates are used to enforce compliance of certain standards for issuing certificates from your CA. These standards include key usages, subject attributes, basic constraints, and other certificate attributes. These use of templates is important to prevent accidental misissuance and to ensure that issued certificates are complant with your security practices. All certificate signing on PKIaaS.io will be associated with a template.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#create-new-templates","title":"Create New Templates","text":"<p>By default, a \"Web Server\" template is automatically built for every CA that is created. This template has a good out-of-the-box configuration for issuing TLS/SSL certificates for web servers, but new, custom certificate templates can be created by navigating to Certificate Templates -&gt; Create Template. In the form type a name, and choose the default settings for your new template by selecting an option in the \"Starter Template\" dropdown.

It also shows the public URL that can be shared for others to submit a certificate request. This option allows users to submit a CSR or fill out a form containing the desired subject attributes and SANs. The latter option can be helpful for users that are not familiar with x509 certificates and includes an option to generate a private key automatically in the browser when they claim their certificate after it is approved.</p>"},{"location":"use-cases/sample-use-case/","title":"Sample Use Case","text":""},{"location":"use-cases/sample-use-case/#sample-use-case","title":"Sample Use Case","text":""}]}
